# 1. Karl Pearson's Coefficient of Correlation Calculator

This Python script calculates the coefficient of correlation between two datasets (x and y)

What Does the Program Do?
The user is prompted to enter values for x and y as a single line of integers separated by spaces.

The program calculates the sum of squares for x, y, and z, as well as the means (average values) of x, y, and z.

It then computes the sum of squares of deviations from the means for x, y, and z.

The program calculates the square roots of the sum of squares of deviations for x and y.

Using these calculations, it determines the numerator and denominator components for Pearson's coefficient of correlation formula.

Finally, it computes and displays the coefficient of correlation between x and y.
## Usage

1. Run the script by executing `correlationCalculator.py`.

2. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the values for `x` and `y` separated by spaces.

3. The script will then calculate the coefficient of correlation and display the results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- math module

## Examples

```shell
Enter values of x separated by spaces: 1 2 3 4 5
Enter values of y separated by spaces: 5 4 3 2 1
